          Overview
        </h3>
        <div class="text">
          While the names of machine learning and synthetic biology are well
          known to the general public, the fact is that they may not be aware of
          the more detailed mechanisms involved - including our iGEM
          competition. We believe it is important and urgent to spread this
          important knowledge to public. The importance of educating students as
          potential participants in iGEM competition and as possible future
          synthetic biologists should not be underestimated. Thus, we held three
          science lectures for students with different ages.

          The Science and Technology Museum is the best place to popularize
          science knowledge to the public. We contacted with the staff at the
          beginning and successfully held our science lecture. Our event was
          also announced on the museum's WeChat account(similar to twitter or
          Instagram) and more than 300 people had known our event before it
          started. In order to make our event more interesting and easier to
          understand, we made a brochure and carefully selected lively and
          in-depth videos about synthetic biology and machine learning. At the
          same time, we prepared a few simple questions based on the content of
          the video, and those children who answered actively would receive a
          small gift from us.

          Although it was rainy that day, people's enthusiasm for seeking
          knowledge was not dampened. People were fascinated by the brochure and
          videos we prepared and gathered around us to listen to the science
          lectures prepared by our team members. The children not only actively
          answered our questions, but also became more interested in this topic.

          In addition, what surprised us more was that we met a lady whose work
          is about E. coli. After listening to our presentation, she inquired in
          details about the current application of machine learning in synthetic
          biology. She said it was a very interesting and promising project
          because it would greatly help them to reduce the workload of
          experiments. What’s more, it could also assist them to think more
          about experimental innovation and project improvement instead of being
          tired of repetitive experiments.

          Although our lecture was only for one morning, the response was pretty
          enthusiastic.We think it was an important and positive interaction
          with the public, and both children and parents said the event was
          pretty fun and helped them learn about new areas. At the same time,
          the staff of the Science and Technology Museum also commented on some
          flaws in our activities, such as the lectures can be more lively and
          more examples can be used. We took their comments seriously and tried
          to avoid these problems in our follow-up work.

        <div class="text">
          We came to the class of Hefei No. 45 Middle School for delivering a
          lecture to students, which was mainly divided into three parts,
          introducing iGEM synthetic biology, introducing artificial
          intelligence and experiencing our platform.
        </div>
        <img src="~static/img/T--USTC-Software--Junior7.jpg" />
        <div class="text">
          We first distributed our brochures to everyone, in which the in-depth
          explanations and vivid models directly aroused great enthusiasm among
          the students. On this basis, we introduced the development of AI to
          them. These children were very interested in the intersection of AI
          and synthetic biology while learning a certain amount about AI. Then
          we focused on introducing synthetic biology and iGEM competition to
          the students. During the presentation, their eyes shone with curiosity
          about synthetic biology, and they expressed to us their imagination
          about the future applications of synthetic biology - we were amazed by
          the children's whimsical ideas. Their reactions made us more confident
          do well in human practice. When the iGEM competition was mentioned
          later, one student even expressed the idea of competing in the future
          as well. Finally, some children tried using our platform, and although
          they did not fully understand the functions of the platform, the
          students still showed great interest. We sincerely hope these students
          who are curious about synthetic biology can join us, becoming the
          future generation of iGEMers.

          At the same time, the teachers really enjoyed the presentation. They
          also believed that this lecture would enable students to get in touch
          with this field earlier, and it could inspire their interest and make
          them imagine more about the future.

          For high school students who will be entering college soon, they are
          not only equipped with a broader perspective and rich knowledge of
          biology, but also have the potential to participate in iGEM
          competitions or even become synthetic biologists in the future.

          Our basic process was basically similar to the lecture at the junior
          high school.There are some slight differences that we added some more
          difficult knowledge and samples in our presentation.

          Even after the meeting, they still asked our speakers about some key
          issues, such as the operation of machine learning algorithms, ethical
          issues of synthetic biology, and so on. At the same time, they were
          very eager to use our platform. And after using it, they gave comments
          on the art design of the page, the operation that can be optimized and
          the explanation of the model and the biological part. We listened
          carefully and optimized our platform.

          To our surprise, some students wrote reviews on papers to express
          their appreciation for our work and some insights about synthetic
          biology as well as computer science. "We hope that we can best combine
          biology and computer science to create a better future for humanity.”
