          The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adapted by all UN
          Member States in 2015 which call for actions “to end poverty, protect
          the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone,
          everywhere” and are set to by achieved by 2030<sup>[1]</sup>. <br />
          As iGEMers, we have the responsibility and passion to participate in
          developing solutions towards meeting the SDGs. From project selection
          to researching and implementation, we take the sustainable development
          issues into account and try to match the goals when we design CAT’s
          functions. When CAT was born, it directly support #4 Quality Education
          and #9 Industries, Innovation and Infrastructure.

          Goal 4: Quality Education
        </h3>
        <div class="text">
          Access to quality education is the foundation of improving people's
          lives and achieving sustainable development. We believe, and it has
          been proven, that education is one of the greatest drivers of
          sustainable development, and therefore inclusive, quality education
          for all must be achieved.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          During the development of CAT, we realized that CAT, the online tool
          software for predicting proteins using machine learning methods, could
          serve as a window for self-learning knowledge, stimulate users'
          interest in learning bioinformatics and encourage them to study more
          relevant works. Consequently, we have developed CAT educational
          version and designed educational content for it. The educational
          version content is suitable for high school students and above.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          By using CAT educational version, users can learn about Traditional
          Biological Methods and Machine Learning:

        <div class="text">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Traditional Biological Methods: experimental methods which depends
              on different protein properties, such as fluorescent protein in
              situ localization method for subcellular localization; X-ray
              diffraction pattern method, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and
              cryo EM methods for transmembrane topology prediction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Machine Learning Methods: the history of machine learning, basic
              ML models and models uesd in CAT, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          After learning these knowledges, users will know the pros and cons of
          each, traditional methods and machine learning methods.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          We believe that with CAT educational version, users will be able to
          learn about biology and machine learning in an intuitive yet fun way.
          In the future, more people can start using professional version of CAT
          to conduct their own exploration and research.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Since 2020, online education has become a necessary and mainstream
          form of education as a result of the rapid global spread of the
          COVID-19 and many countries have announced the temporary closure of
          schools, which affects more than 91 percent of the world's students -
          1.6 billion children and youth<sup>[2]</sup>. In this case, we hope
          that CAT educational version will enable students to learn about
          cutting-edge knowledge, stimulate students' interest so that students
          will further learn related knowledge through the Internet. Thus,
          students can build a foundation for higher level learning through CAT
          educational version.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          For teachers, CAT educational version can be a platform for teaching
          biology or computer courses related to practical applications,
          enriching the form and content of the classroom and improving the
          quality of online education. We welcome teachers to use CAT
          educational version in the class to guide students with a practical
          example.

          Goal 9: Industries, Innovation and Infrastructure
        </h3>
        <div class="text">
          Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, innovation and
          infrastructure, can make the economy more dynamic and generate
          employment and income. In addition, they play a key role in
          introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international
          trade and enabling the efficient use of resources.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Global manufacturing growth had been gradually declining even before
          the epidemic, while the COVID-19 dealt a severe blow to manufacturing,
          disrupting global chains and product supply. Innovation and
          technological progress are key to finding lasting solutions to
          economic and environmental challenges, such as increased resource and
          energy efficiency, and therefore greater investment in research and
          innovation is required to accelerate manufacturing growth in the
          current circumstances.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          We note that almost the entire population of the world lives in areas
          covered by mobile networks. It is estimated that in 2019, 96.5% are
          covered by at least a 2G network with 81.8% covered by at least a
          Long-Term Evolution network<sup>[3]</sup>. So the enrichment of
          knowledge in the Internet and the production of more online tools can
          ensure people around the world work entrepreneurially and
          innovatively, which offset the impact of the epidemic and the gap
          between different levels of development.

          CAT was designed to build an online toolset for researchers in
          protein-related fields to make protein property predictions easily and
          quickly. By using CAT, users can use machine learning methods to make
          protein predictions and obtain relevant reference data. With the
          development of machine learning for protein prediction, CAT will
          introduce more and more accurate online prediction tools in the
          foreseeable future, becoming an online platform that integrates most
          of the mainstream machine learning methods for protein property
          prediction. Furthermore, we hope that CAT can become an open platform
          for researchers to submit models with a standardized form and share
          achievement, which will definitely make CAT become stronger and
          bigger.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          We believe that with the help of CAT, more researchers can participate
          in protein prediction, promote protein engineering, and provide more
          effective solutions for agriculture, medicine, environment, etc. We
          hope that with the continuous development and progress of
          bioinformatics, machine learning can be better involved in biological
          research.
