            I am Zhen Wang from USTC majored in quantum computation. I built an
            interface between online server and local data. Local data were
            provided in file formats such as .txt. The contents of files were
            nucleotide and amino acid sequences. This interface transports files
            to an online server. Then the online server calculates, and offers a
            structure prediction of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
            Finally, the interface returns the result to the main program. It
            was an interesting experience working with teammates. Fortunately, I

            supported the team with biological knowledge throughout the project
            selection, design, and final testingDuring the creation of CAT, I
            read a lot of paper related to machine learning and protein
            prediction, and looked up relevant datasets and tools. In short, I
            learned a lot about synthetic biology in this process, which made me
            more interested in this cross-cutting field.Thanks iGEM for this
            unforgettable experience of working with other team members in
            USTC-Software!
