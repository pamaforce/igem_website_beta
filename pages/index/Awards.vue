          We are from different departments, and because of iGEM, we come
          together and collide ideas. Besides, the success of the project can’t
          be achieved without the support of some teachers and students. You can
          read more about those people who have supported us through this
          project <a href="./Attributions">here</a>.

          We were inspired by a presentation on the emerging intersection of
          machine learning and synthetic biology, Our biochemistry faculty and
          classmates solidified our confidence that our project would be
          successful. See for more details <a href="./Description">here</a> on
          how we achieved our project goals, its unique advantages, and more .

          <div class="texttitle"><span>✔</span> Contribution</div>
          As a software team, we believe that we have made a substantial
          contribution to the iGEM community. We provide a tool for researchers
          and iGEMers to use machine learning to predict some protein
          properties. Besides we also provide a tool to predict RNA secondary
          structure, the project developed by SJTU-Software.<br /><br />
          Apart from that, we have an educational version, which we’re committed
          to use to make more students more aware of synthetic biology and
          machine learning. You can see more detailed information about our
          contribution for iGEM community and synthetic biology

          Our project went through several iterations, which included the idea
          of the project, the birth of the education version and the detailed
          design of the project, etc. With each iteration, we got a little
          better at our project. Eventually we can provide tools to predict
          protein properties and more importantly can contribute to education in
          synthetic biology and machine learning.

          We received a lot of help and support from the USTC team from the very
          beginning of our design, and with their help we have continued to
          optimize and improve our project - thanks to the constant online and
          offline communication and meetings between our two teams. In addition,
          at the CCiC conference, we met constantly with the SJTU-Software team
          and exchanged ideas about synthetic biology, machine learning, and
          other areas. For more details, click

          Our project can really simplify protein property prediction and help
          people understand the intersection of machine learning and synthetic
          biology. We are constantly talking to teachers and students to get
          their input on our project. We participated in the CCiC 2021 and
          exchanged with other university teams. We also collaborate with
          science museums and schools to organize large scale science events.

          Our project is aimed at synthetic biologists who need to predict
          protein properties or who are interested in machine learning. With our
          platform they can retrieve faster or enter the field of machine
          learning faster. In addition, we have detailed the possible risks and

          We are constantly reflecting on our projects in human practice, which
          helps us improve and enhance our platform. Through continuous
          communication with teachers, our project has evolved from a single
          machine learning prediction model to a comprehensive platform; through
          communication with students, we have been able to optimize the
          presentation of our model to make it more understandable to beginners.
          At the same time, we collected feedback from users on the beta version
          and made more complete modifications and adjustments to the platform
          to get the current version. We have documented our process and click

          Many technics are implemented in our web design model, including Nginx
          for load balance, gunicorn for WSGI middleware, Flask for api design,
          Redis for result cache. And for biology part, there are also some
          machine-learning models to be illustrated in detail. You will know

          The software incorporated in our platform has the support of published
          papers. The concepts and models used have been tested by various
          cross-validations and have obtained notable results. We had to ensure
          that the included software packages have a very high accuracy to
          facilitate the synthetic biologists’ use. Visit the

          In our ongoing conversations with the USTC and SJTU-Software teams, we
          realized that our partnership could be deepened. At a later stage of
          the project, we had joint group meetings with the USTC team to discuss
          the progress of the project and the optimizations that could be made.
          In talking with the SJTU-Software team, we realized that we could try
          to accommodate each other's content. So we kept communicating with
          them and eventually made their package available to run on our
          platform to deepen the understanding of the relationship between RNA
          and proteins. You can know details <a href="./Partnership">here</a>.

          </div>
          We have made an educational version to enable more students to
          understand and learn about synthetic biology and machine learning. We
          have given a lot of thought to the effectiveness of education,
          especially in terms of interaction. We use easy-to-understand examples
          to explain the principles. In addition, we have made a brochure to
          make the education more effective. We have conducted many educational
          activities using educational version and brochures, and they all have
          achieved good results. You can visit this
          <a href="./Education">link</a> to know details about our educational
          work.<br /><br />
          We had a lot of communication with the professional teachers at our
          school to make sure that our program was helpful for synthetic
          biology. We also talked to the directors of our educational activities
          to make sure that our educational content and approach was effective
          for the students.
